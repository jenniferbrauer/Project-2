**Aritistic Turtle Project - Sunset With Land And Sea using Turtle Graphics**



This Python script utilizes the Turtle graphics to create a scenic landscape featuring clouds, a sun, grass, and a ocean wave. 


**Prerequisites**

You don't need any special installations for this project. Python comes with the turtle library built-in.

**Description**
This script draws various graphical elements using Turtle graphics:

	Rectangle Drawing: The draw_rectangle function draws rectangles with specified dimensions and colours.

	Grass Drawing: The draw_grass function generates grassy patches on the ground.

	Cloud Drawing: The draw_swirly_clouds function creates swirly cloud shapes at predefined positions.

	Circle Drawing: The draw_circle function is used to draw a sun with multiple colourful circles.

	Sine Wave: The draw_sine_wave function generates a sine wave pattern resembling waves.


**Getting Started**

To make beautiful sunset art, follow these steps:

  1. Open Python.

 2. Copy and paste the code into a Python script.

  3. Customize by adjusting parameters such as colours, positions, or dimensions to create different scenic designs.

4.   Run the script and watch the magic happen!

  Click on the Turtle graphics window to close it when you're done.

**Play Around**

Feel free to change the colours too! In the colours list, you can pick your own shades to create a unique colour palette. 
Here is a great link on github to see different colours understood by Python: https://github.com/paztronomer/blog/blob/master/code/p01_python_colors/named_colors.png

This project is all about having fun and being creative. It's perfect for making colourful, creative designs and showing off your artistic side.

Enjoy making your own Turtle art! :)
